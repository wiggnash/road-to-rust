# Rust Daily Notes

Welcome to the Rust Daily Notes repository! This repo serves as a collection of my daily notes and learnings as I dive into the Rust programming language. Each note is formatted as a Markdown (.md) file, making it easy to open and read using various Markdown viewers, especially **Obsidian**.

## What is Obsidian?

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful knowledge management and note-taking tool that allows users to create a network of linked notes. Here are a few key features that make Obsidian a popular choice for organizing notes:

- **Linking Notes**: Create connections between your notes easily, allowing for a more holistic approach to learning.
- **Graph View**: Visualize the relationships between your notes in an interactive graph format.
- **Markdown Support**: Use a simple text format to create rich documents that include images, links, and code snippets.
- **Customizability**: Extend Obsidianâ€™s functionality with plugins to fit your workflow.
