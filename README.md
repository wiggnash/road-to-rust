Rust Daily Notes

Welcome to the Rust Daily Notes repository! This repo serves as a collection of my daily notes and learnings as I dive into the Rust programming language. Each note is formatted as a Markdown (.md) file, making it easy to open and read using various Markdown viewers, especially Obsidian.


What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management and note-taking tool that allows users to create a network of linked notes. Here are a few key features that make Obsidian a popular choice for organizing notes:



Linking Notes: Create connections between your notes easily, allowing for a more holistic approach to learning.

Graph View: Visualize the relationships between your notes in an interactive graph format.

Markdown Support: Use a simple text format to create rich documents that include images, links, and code snippets.

Customizability: Extend Obsidianâ€™s functionality with plugins to fit your workflow.
