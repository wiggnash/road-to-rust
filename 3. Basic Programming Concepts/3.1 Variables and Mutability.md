Variables in RUST are immutable by default and we will be able to make the variable mutable

**What is immutable ?**
Once the value is attached to a name , that we wont abe able to change the name

**Error** : Error we get in this code is that we cannot reassign the immutable variable

```
Because at first we are telling that the value will never change and in the upcoming steps we are changing its value
```

*Advantages of Immutable Variables*
1. Taking advantage of the safety
2. Concurrency

## what is mutablitly ?

- we are telling that an value of the variable can be changed by the other part of program

# Constants

Constants are values that are attached to a name and this will not change

*What are the differences between variables and constants* ?

- we cannot change the constants from immutable to mutable by adding an *mut* keyword : **constants are always immutable**
- const keywords must be annotated
- **Scope of Constans :** We can declare it any scope and these are valid for the entire time of the program, within the scope in which they were declared. ex : Global Scope => which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about 
- **Value of Constants :** These are set only using the constant expression , we cannot give constants some run time values
- **Naming Convention of Constants :** Uppercase and underscore between words
