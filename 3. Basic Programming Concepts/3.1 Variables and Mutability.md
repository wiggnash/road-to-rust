Variables in RUST are **immutable by default** and we will be able to make the variable mutable by adding *mut* keyword

```
NOTE : We are not allowed to mutate a variable's type
```

**What is immutable ?**
Once the value is attached to a name , that we wont abe able to change the value

**Error** : Error we get in this code is that we cannot reassign the immutable variable

```
Because at first we are telling that the value will never change and in the upcoming steps we are changing its value
```

*Advantages of Immutable Variables*
1. Safety
2. Concurrency

## what is mutablitly ?
- we are telling that an value of the variable can be changed by the other part of program

# Constants

Constants are values that are attached to a name and this will not change and its always immutable
We will be able to define the Hardcoded values at one place and changing it will reflect at all the places

**How to assign an constant ?**
```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

*What are the differences between variables and constants* ?
- we cannot change the constants from immutable to mutable by adding an *mut* keyword : **constants are always immutable**
- const keywords must be annotated
- **Scope of Constans :** We can declare it any scope and these are valid for the entire time of the program, within the scope in which they were declared. 
	- Global Scope => which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about 
- **Value of Constants :** These are set only using the constant expression , we cannot give constants some run time values
- **Naming Convention of Constants :** Uppercase and underscore between words

# Shadowing

- Declaring variables with the same name , therefore the second variable is what the complier will see when you use the name of the variable
- we can tranform the value , its type but use the same name
