Rust is **Statically typed language** : it must know the types of all variables at complie time. Every value in RUST is a data type , which makes the complier to make it easy to work with that data

Complier will be able to tell what is the type of the data that we are using 
## Types of Data 

1. Scalar : Represents single value
	1. Integers
	2. FloatingPoint
	3. Numbers
	4. Booleans
	5. Characters
2. Compound

# Scalar Values

## Integers : Number without fraction
Integers can be both positive and negative , therfore it has two types. Takes 32 bits of space by default
1. *Signed Integers ( i )* : Both positive and negative numbers  : Value range => -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 **inclusive** and n is the number of bits
2. *Unsigned Integers ( u )* : Only positive numbers : Value range => 0 to 2n - 1

### How can signed numbers stored ?

Signed numbers are stored in the 2's Complement representation


### Size of the Integers 

- Depends on the architecuture of the computer in which the program is running
- 32bit Arch or 64bit Arch
