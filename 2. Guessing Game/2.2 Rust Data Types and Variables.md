Variables in RUST are immutable by default , which means that it cannot be modified.
If we want the values to be changed or reassigned , Then change the **immutable variable to the mutable variable**
## Special Data Type

1. **Unit Type** : Empty Paranthesis. ( ) Singular value which is completely empty.
	1. null value or void
	2. empty value in the database
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    understand_variables();
}

fn understand_variables() {
    let unit_type: () = ();
    println!("Unit Type: {:?}", unit_type);
}

```

## Integers

### Types of Integers

- Signed Integers: We can have both **negative and positive values**
- Unsigned Integers: We can only have **Positive values** , because there is no reserved bit or the sign bit
	- Therefore the range of the unsigned value range is more 
	- but it can hold only positive values
#### Difference between Signed and Unsigned Integers

In base 2 , A bit can be only Binary value which is 1 or 0. 
In base 10, Its 0 - 9 

- In Integers the first bit is called sign bit , where it is reserved to store the sign value of an integer.
- Therefore the number of total bits reduces,  therefore the total range of values the variable can take reduced depending on the length

- we can reserve different amount of memory for integer
- Generally stick to the smaller size possible , we will save space and memory
---
## Floating Point values

- To hold decimal values 
- Only 32 and 64bit floating point number

**Note** : In order to do any mathamatical operation , we need same data type to perform the operation

---
## Type Casting / Coercion

Here we will convert one data type to an another data type

---
## Boolean Values

- True or False
- On or Off

---

# Strings

The string value is determined with the quotes that we are using
- char type - single quote
- string type - double quote

**char**  : 4 bytes in size , unit code values

### Strings

 - these are variable length
 - string pointer by default

- Need to understand what is an string pointer and understand the concept
---

## Tuple

- its like an array
- but with different data types also can be possible , in array we will contain only the same datatype
