Cargo is Rust’s 
- build system and package manager. 
- It performs tasks like
	- such as building your code, 
	- downloading the libraries your code depends on, 
	- building those libraries.

Cargo expects your source files to live inside the _src_ directory. 
The top-level project directory is just for 

- README files, 
- license information, 
- configuration files, and 
- anything else not related to your code. 

Using Cargo helps you organize your projects. There’s a place for everything, and everything is in its place.
